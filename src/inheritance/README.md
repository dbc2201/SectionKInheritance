## Binding
It is the associating of a method call to its method body.
It has the following two types:

### Static Binding
When the binding  is performed by the compiler, at the compile-time, it is known as
`static binding` or `early binding`.
Binding for all static, private, and final methods is done at compile time.

### Dynamic Binding
